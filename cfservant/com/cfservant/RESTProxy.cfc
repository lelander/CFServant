 	This is forthcoming, feel free to contribute.  Everything we need is in the GenService aside from mapping the URIs.
	As an aside, I originally felt this was super important, but I never use a truly RESTful interface.  I always like to call methods 
	like get() and post() explicitly instead.  GenServiceProxy already makes these methods available so I'm waiting to see how many 
	people really want this before investing the time.
